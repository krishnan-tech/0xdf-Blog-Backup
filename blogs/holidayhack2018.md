![](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/hh18-cover.png) The [Sans Holiday
Hack](https://www.holidayhackchallenge.com) is one of the events I most look
forward to each year. This year’s event is based around
[KringleCon](https://kringlecon.com/), an infosec conference organized by
Santa as a response to the fact that there have been so many attempts to hack
Christmas over the last few years. This conference even has a [bunch of
talks](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNiR-C_VXv_TCFgww5Vczag), some quite
useful for completing the challenge, but others that as just interesting as on
their own. To complete the Holiday Hack Challenge, I’m asked to enter this
virtual conference, walk around, and solve a series of technical challenges.
As usual, the challenges were interesting and set up in such a way that it was
very beginner friendly, with lots of hints and talks to ensure that you
learned something while solving. The designers also implemented several more
defensive / forensic challenges this year, which was neat to see.

## KringleCon

KringleCon takes place at Santa’s Castle. Once the gates opened, I walked over
the bridge, and was greeted by Santa himself:

Clicking on my badge reveals 10 objectives:

The solution to each of these objectives, with each associated terminal
challenge, are given on the pages that follow. Additionally, the appendix
provides information beyond the scope of the objectives, but potentially still
of interest.

## KringleCon

On walking into the castle, there are numerous characters, terminals, and
puzzles to interact with. I’ve created this map tracking the various
characters and challenges I’ll interact with throughout the challenge:
