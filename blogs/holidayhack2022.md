The 2022 SANS Holiday Hack Challenge is a battle to recover the five golden
rings stolen from Santa by Grinchum. This all takes place at the North Pole
where Santa is hosting the 5th annual KringleCon, including
[talks](https://www.sans.org/mlp/holiday-hack-challenge#kringlecon) from 11
leaders in the information security community. In addition to the talks, there
are six objectives to solve, each consisting of multiple terminals and/or
challenges. In solving all of these, I’ll recover the five rings, and in the
process clear the magic that’s created Grinchum, turning him back into
Smilegol. As usual, the challenges were interesting and set up in such a way
that it was very beginner friendly, with lots of hints and talks to ensure
that you learned something while solving.
