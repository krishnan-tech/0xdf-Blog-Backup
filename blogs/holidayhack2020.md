The 2020 SANS Holiday Hack Challenge was less of a challenge to figure out who
did it, and more picking apart how Jack Frost managed to hack Santa’s
processes. This all takes place at the third annual Kringle Con, where the
worlds leading security practitioners show up for talks and challenges. Hosted
at back at a currently-being-renovated North Pole, this years conference
included [13 talks from leaders in information
security](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjLd1hNA7YVwqXqaBJfbXqkFb7LKw3r31),
as well as 12 terminals / in-game puzzles and 11 objectives to solve. In
solving all of these, the Jack Frost’s plot was foiled. As usual, the
challenges were interesting and set up in such a way that it was very beginner
friendly, with lots of hints and talks to ensure that you learned something
while solving.

## Introduction

The game picks up just off the New Jersey Turnpike at Santa’s gondola, where
Jingle Ringford offer a ride to the North Pole:

Jingle also tells me about the Kringle Con badge and unlocks the first
objective. On heading into the gondola I’m dropped at the North Pole, where
Santa greets me:
