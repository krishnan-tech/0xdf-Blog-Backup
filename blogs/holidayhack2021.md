The 2021 SANS Holiday Hack Challenge was the battle of two competing
conferences. Santa is hosting the 4th annual KringleCon at the North Pole, and
Jack Front has set up a competing conference next door, FrostFest. This years
challenge conference included [14 talks from leaders in information
security](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRbd2C6NHOg&list=PLjLd1hNA7YVx99qJF3OoPF-
qunjqw-SoU), including a late entry from the elf, Professor Qwerty Petabyte,
covering Log4j. In addition to the talks, there were 15 terminals / in-game
puzzles and 13 objectives to solve. In solving all of these, the Jack Frost’s
plot was foiled. As usual, the challenges were interesting and set up in such
a way that it was very beginner friendly, with lots of hints and talks to
ensure that you learned something while solving.
