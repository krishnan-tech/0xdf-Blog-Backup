My first submission to HTB, SecNotes, went live today! I was aiming for an
easy (20 pt) Windows box, but it released as a medium (30 pt) box. First blood
for user just fell, 1 hour and 9 minutes in. Still waiting on root. I hope
people enjoy, and if you do the box, please reach out to me on the forums or
direct message and let me know what you thought of it, and how you solved it.
Iâ€™d be very excited to hear if there were any unintended paths discovered.
