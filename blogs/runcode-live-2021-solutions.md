I’ve been posting solutions on YouTube for the RunCode Live 2021 competition
held 11-13 November 2021. This a a programming CTF, so I’ll show how I
approach various problems using mostly Python. Check them out, and subscribe
on YouTube to get notified as I add more videos.

All videos (including already posted and more to come) will be available in
[this
playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJt6nPUdQbiS_oiYPNtMmOCo3j59xE6yF).
The first video goes over what RunCode is and how it works as well:
