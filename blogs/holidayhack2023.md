The 2023 challenge, _A Holiday Odyssey, Featuring 6: Geese A-Lei’ing!_ , takes
place in the Geese Islands, where Santa has moved his operation on the advice
of his new AI, ChatNPT. I’ll work through a series of technical (and physical)
challenges to find that it’s Jack Frost behind the AI, working from space,
trying to destroy Christmas. In the end, I’ll hack into his space system and
redirect his missile away from Earth into the sun. The SANS Holiday Hack is
something I look forward to each year, and 2023 did not disappoint.
